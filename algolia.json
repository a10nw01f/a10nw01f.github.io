Usually, in order to see the effect of a change in code we need to close the process, compile a new version, start the process again and then reach a specific part or scenario in the program - this entire flow can be very slow. DLL live reloading can decrease iteration times by replacing an old DLL with a new one during runtime without even closing the process so that we can observe the changes almost immediatly.","tags":null,"title":"Live DLL Reloading","type":"post","url":"/live_dll_reloading/","weight":0,"wordcount":1101},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1643932800,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1643932800,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://a10nw01f.github.io/post/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/post/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts","type":"post","url":"/post/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1641772800,"description":"","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":1100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641772800,"objectID":"dd2297e775b269d068f528fc4d17383b","permalink":"https://a10nw01f.github.io/generative_cpp/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T00:00:00Z","readingtime":5,"relpermalink":"/generative_cpp/","section":"post","summary":"Code Generation in C++ The two main ways to generate code in c++ are templates and macros.
